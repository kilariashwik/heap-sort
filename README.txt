Contribution:

My team members including me seperately have wrritten our own codes on our own logic. After 
writing the codes we discussed among our selves and analysed the codes made corrections in the code 
and we executed all the three codes we find some logical error in the codes by comparing all three codes 
we corrected and make a single code and executed the code at last we got the out put.
The code was written in java language so we can execute the code normally
Challenges faced and addressing problems:-
Many errors occurred because of missing  logics
We cleared our errors one by one and got the output and we struggled for lot of time

Conclusion:-
• Team work until makes things simple and easy to do in short span
• Ideas of each are made complex things simple
• Due to team work the work become easy
• No google logics were used while writing program
Inovacation and the rules of reversing of string
• From the given question Our main theme is to implement heap sort of the given sequence of numbers.

For example:when the input sequence of numbers are 2,10,3,1,4,8,5,6,11,9.
The output should be 11,10,9,8,6,5,4,3,2,1.

• Rules for heap sort

1) bulid a max heap for input data.

2)At this point ,the largest item is stored at the root of the heap.replace it with last item of the heap followed by reducing the size of the heap by 1.

3) repeat the above step while size of the heap is greater than 1.
